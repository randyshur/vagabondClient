Vagabond App

Created By: Randy Shurzinske, Miski Muse, Maddie Ijams, and Quinn Crabtree

This App allows you to share different landmarks across the country.

Vagabond is an unique way to capture and share the coolest landmarks in America. Browse your friend's and family's to see what they’re up to, and discover landmarks from all over the country that are sharing places that they love. Join the community of over 1 billion people and express yourself by sharing all the moments of your trips — the highlights and everything in between, too.

We have implemented full CRUD on two tables with the use of  the Angular framework for the frontend. For the Server, we also used Postgres, Express, and Node.js.  We used Angular Material and CSS to style. 

The users are allowed to create a profile and signup. Once logged in, they are able to log landmarks and states that they have been to. The admin portal allows the Admin to update and delete landmarks and states from any user. 

We deployed both the server and the client frontend using Heroku.
